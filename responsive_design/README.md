RESPONSIVE DESIGN

THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF RESPONSIVE DESIGN

In this article we will discuss the main essential components of responsive design.

Web developers are increasingly being asked to construct a Web site or app that adapts its user interface according to the browser or device used to access the site to deliver an optimal user experience. One solution is to construct separate versions of your site/app for various platforms or browsers and deliver them accordingly after determining which browser or platform is seeing your site..

Create a single version of your code that doesn't care about the browser or platform accessing the site. Use feature tests to determine which browser features are supported and adjust the code accordingly.

Responsive design is the term commonly used for describing that approach.

Responsive design is far more dependable, manageable, and future-proof than having numerous versions of your code for various browsers and systems. With responsive design, you don't have to keep releasing new site versions as new browsers and platforms are released, or adjusting code as feature support in existing browsers changes.

There are several drawbacks to the responsive-design approach, however. If the content, layout, and functionality must change significantly for multiple devices, this may not be the best strategy. Also, adding responsiveness to an existing site to make it mobile/tablet friendly might take a lot more effort than just establishing a distinct mobile site or app, especially if it is a large business site.
